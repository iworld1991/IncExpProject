I first document the following empirical patterns of subjective income profile utilizing a density survey. First, earners who are younger, from younger generations and from low-income households have higher perceived risks. Second, perceptions of risks countercyclically react to recent realizations of labor market outcomes. Third, there is a skewed U-shaped correlation between individual risk perceptions and current income. Theoretically, these empirical patterns can be reconciled by a model of learning from past experiences of income realizations based on subjective attribution of the nature of income shocks. By introducing attribution errors due to the psychological tendency to external attribution for bad news and internal attribution for good news, the model provides a consistent explanation for the U-shaped income-profile of risk perceptions and its countercyclical dynamics.\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Income risks matter for both individual behaviors and aggregate
outcomes. With identical expected income and homogeneous risk
preferences, different degrees of risks lead to different
saving/consumption and portfolio choices. This is well understood in
models in which agents are inter-temporally risk-averse, or prudent, and
the risks associated with future marginal utility motivate precautionary
motives. Since it is widely known from the empirical research that
idiosyncratic income risks are at most partially insured
(\cite{blundell_consumption_2008}) or because of borrowing constraints,
such behavioral regularities equipped with market incompleteness leads
to ex-post unequal wealth distribution and different degrees of marginal
propensity to consume (MPC). This has important implications for the
transmission of macroeconomic policies.

One important assumption prevailing in macroeconomic models with
uninsured risks is that agents have a perfect understanding of the
income risks. Under the assumption, economists typically estimate the
income process based on micro income data and then treat the estimates
as the true model parameters known by the agents making decisions in the
model. But given the mounting evidence that people form expectations in
ways deviating from full-information rationality, leading to perennial
heterogeneity in economic expectations held by micro agents, this
assumption seems to be too stringent. To the extent that agents make
decisions based on their \emph{respective} perceptions, understanding
the \emph{perceived} income risk profile and its correlation structure
with other macro variables are the keys to explaining their behavior
patterns.

This paper constructs a subjective model of learning that features
agents' imperfect understanding of the size as well as the nature of
income risks. In terms of the size, the imperfect understanding is
modeled as a lack of knowledge of the true parameter of an assumed
income process. Agents form their best guess about the parameters by
learning from the past experienced income of their own as well as
others. Such experience-based learning mechanisms engenders the
perceived risks to be dependent on age, generation, and macroeconomic
history. At the same time, the imperfect understanding of the nature of
risks is captured by assuming that individuals do not understand if the
income risks are commonly shared aggregate shock or idiosyncratic ones.
They learn about the model based on a subjective determination of the
nature of the past shocks, which is called \emph{attribution} in this
paper. With different subjective attributions, agents arrive at
different degrees of model parameter uncertainty, thus different
perceptions about income risks.

In a general setting within the model, I show that a higher degree of
external attribution, i.e.~perceiving the shocks to be common ones
instead of idiosyncratic ones, leads to higher risk perceptions. This
introduces a well-specified channel through which some imperfect
understanding of the nature of shocks leads to differences in risk
perceptions. The intuition for this is straightforward. As an
econometrician would perfectly understand, learning comes from
variations in the sample either cross-sectionally or over time. As
agents subjectively perceive the correlation of her own income shocks
and others' to be higher, the uncertainty associated with the parameter
estimate is naturally higher because the cross-sectional variation from
the sample useful to the learning is reduced. I show such a mechanism is
generalizable to different assumed income processes such as AR1 or one
with permanent/transitory components of time-varying risks.

Incorporating attribution in learning allows it possible to explore the
implications of possible mischaracterization of experienced shocks.
Among various possible deviations, I explore a particular kind of
attribution error which is reminiscent of the ``self-serving bias'' in
the social psychology. In particular, it assumes that people have a
tendency to external (internal) attribution in the face of negative
(positive) experiences. By allowing the subjective correlation to be a
function of the recent experience such as income change, the model
neatly captures this psychological tendency. What is interesting is that
such a state-dependence of attribution in learning may help explain why
the average perceived risk is lower for the high-income groups than the
low-income ones. In the presence of aggregate risks, it also generates
counter-cyclical patterns of the average perceived risks, i.e.~bad times
are associated with high subjective risks.

Empirically, the paper sheds light on the perceptions of income risks by
utilizing the recently available density forecasts of labor income
surveyed by New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectation (SCE). What is
special about this survey is that agents are asked to provide
histogram-type forecasts of their earning growth over the next 12 months
together with a set of expectational questions about the macroeconomy.
When the individual density forecast is available, a parametric density
estimation can be made to obtain the individual-specific subjective
distribution. And higher moments reflecting the perceived income risks
such as variance, as well as the asymmetry of the distribution such as
skewness allow me to directly characterize the perceived risk profile
without relying on external estimates from cross-sectional microdata.
This provides the first-hand measured perceptions on income risks that
are truly relevant to individual decisions. Perceived income risks
exhibits a number of important patterns that are consistent with the
predictions of experience-based learning with subjective attribution.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Higher experienced volatility is associated with higher perceived
  income risks. This helps explain why perceived risks differ
  systematically across different generations, who have experienced
  different histories of the income shocks. Besides, perceived risks
  declines with one's age.
\item
  Perceived income risks have a non-monotonic correlation with the
  current income, which can be best described as a skewed U shape.
  Perceived risk decreases with current income over the most range of
  income values follwed by a uppick in perceived risks for high-income
  group.
\item
  Perceived income risks are counter-cyclical with the labor market
  conditions or broadly business cycles. I found that average perceived
  income risks by U.S. earners are negatively correlated with the
  current labor market tightness measured by wage growth and
  unemployment rate. Besides, earners in states with higher unemployment
  rates and low wage growth also perceive income risks to be higher.
  This bears similarities but important difference with a few previous
  studies that document the counter-cyclicality of income risks
  estimated by cross-sectional microdata. (\cite{guvenen2014nature},
  \cite{catherine_countercyclical_2019})
\end{itemize}

These patterns suggest that individuals have a roughly good yet
imperfect understanding of their income risks. Good, in the sense that
subjective perceptions are broadly consistent with the realization of
cross-sectional income patterns. This is attained in my model because
agents learn from past experiences, roughly as econometricians do. In
contrast, subjective perceptions are imperfect in that bounded
rationality prevents people from knowing about the true income process
perfectly, which even hardworking economists equipped with different
advanced econometrical techniques and larger sample of income data
cannot easily claim to have.

As illustrated by many empirical work of testing the rationality in
expectation formation, it is admittedly challenging to separately
account for the differences in perceptions driven by the ``truth'' and
the part driven by the pure subjective heterogeneity. The most
straightforward way seems to be to treat econometrician's external
estimates of the income process as the proxy to the truth, for which the
subjective surveys are compared. But this approach implicitly assumes
that econometricians correctly specify the model of the income process
and ignores the possible superior information that is available only to
the people in the sample but not to econometricians. The model built in
this paper reconciles both possibilities.

Finally, the subjective learning model will be incorporated into an
otherwise standard life-cycle consumption/saving model with uninsured
idiosyncratic and aggregate risks. Experience-based learning makes
income expectations and risks state-dependent when making dynamically
optimal decisions at each point of the time. In particular, higher
perceived risks will induce more precautionary saving behaviors. If this
perceived risk is state-dependent on recent income changes, it will
potentially shift the distribution of MPCs along income deciles,
therefore, amplify the channels aggregate demand responses to shocks.

\hypertarget{related-literature}{%
\subsection{Related literature}\label{related-literature}}

This paper is relevant to four lines of literature. First, the idea of
this paper echoes with an old problem in the consumption insurance
literature: `insurance or information' (\cite{pistaferri_superior_2001},
\cite{kaufmann_disentangling_2009},\cite{meghir2011earnings}). In any
empirical tests of consumption insurance or consumption response to
income, there is always a worry that what is interpreted as the shock
has actually already entered the agents' information set or exactly the
opposite. For instance, the notion of excessive sensitivity, namely
households consumption highly responsive to anticipated income shock,
maybe simply because agents have not incorporated the recently realized
shocks that econometricians assume so (\cite{flavin_excess_1988}). Also,
recently, in the New York Fed
\href{https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/11/understanding-permanent-and-temporary-income-shocks.html}{blog},
the authors followed a similar approach to decompose the permanent and
transitory shocks. My paper shares a similar spirit with these studies
in the sense that I try to tackle the identification problem in the same
approach: directly using the expectation data and explicitly controlling
what are truly conditional expectations of the agents making the
decision. This helps economists avoid making assumptions on what is
exactly in the agents' information set. What differentiates my work from
other authors is that I focus on higher moments, i.e.~income risks and
skewness by utilizing the recently available density forecasts of labor
income. Previous work only focuses on the sizes of the realized shocks
and estimates the variance of the shocks using cross-sectional
distribution, while my paper directly studies the individual specific
variance of these shocks perceived by different individuals. This will
become clear in Section \ref{perceived-income-process-in-progress}.

Second, this paper is inspired by an old but recently reviving interest
in studying consumption/saving behaviors in models incorporating
imperfect expectations and perceptions. For instance,
\cite{rozsypal_overpersistence_2017} found that households' expectation
of income exhibits an over-persistent bias using both expected and
realized household income from Michigan household survey. The paper also
shows that incorporating such bias affects the aggregate consumption
function by distorting the cross-sectional distributions of marginal
propensity to consume(MPCs) across the population.
\cite{carroll_sticky_2018} reconciles the low micro-MPC and high
macro-MPCs by introducing to the model an information rigidity of
households in learning about macro news while being updated about micro
news. \cite{lian2019imperfect} shows that an imperfect perception of
wealth accounts for such phenomenon as excess sensitivity to current
income and higher MPCs out of wealth than current income and so forth.
My paper has a similar flavor to all of these works by exploring the
behavioral implications of households' perceptive imperfection. The
novelty of my paper lies in the primary focus on the implications of
heterogeneity in perceived higher moments such as risks and skewness.
Various theories of expectation formation have different predictions
about the cross-sectional and dynamic patterns of perceived risks. I
examine these predictions in this paper.

This paper also contributes to the literature studying expectation
formation using subjective surveys. There has been a long list of
``irrational expectation'' theories developed in recent decades on how
agents deviate from full-information rationality benchmark, such as
sticky expectation, noisy signal extraction, least-square learning, etc.
Also, empirical work has been devoted to testing these theories in a
comparable manner (\cite{coibion2012can}, \cite{fuhrer2018intrinsic}).
But it is fair to say that thus far, relatively little work has been
done on individual variables such as labor income, which may well be
more relevant to individual economic decisions. Therefore, understanding
expectation formation of the individual variables, in particular,
concerning both mean and higher moments, will provide fruitful insights
for macroeconomic modeling assumptions.

Lastly, the paper is indirectly related to the research that advocated
for eliciting probabilistic questions measuring subjective uncertainty
in economic surveys (\cite{manski_measuring_2004},
\cite{delavande2011measuring}, \cite{manski_survey_2018}). Although the
initial suspicion concerning to people's ability in understanding, using
and answering probabilistic questions is understandable,
\cite{bertrand_people_2001} and other works have shown respondents have
the consistent ability and willingness to assign a probability (or
``percent chance'') to future events. \cite{armantier_overview_2017}
have a thorough discussion on designing, experimenting and implementing
the consumer expectation surveys to ensure the quality of the responses.
Broadly speaking, the advocates have argued that going beyond the
revealed preference approach, availability to survey data provides
economists with direct information on agents' expectations and helps
avoids imposing arbitrary assumptions. This insight holds for not only
point forecast but also and even more importantly, for uncertainty,
because for any economic decision made by a risk-averse agent, not only
the expectation but also the perceived risks matter a great deal.


    \hypertarget{data-variables-and-density-estimation}{%
\section{Data, variables and density
estimation}\label{data-variables-and-density-estimation}}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

The data used for this paper is from the core module of Survey of
Consumer Expectation(SCE) conducted by the New York Fed, a monthly
online survey for a rotating panel of around 1,300 household heads. The
sample period in my paper spans from June 2013 to June 2019, in a total
of 72 months. This makes about 85852 household-year observations, among
which around 55,481 observations provide non-empty answers to the
density question on earning growth.

Particularly relevant for my purpose, the questionnaire asks each
respondent to fill perceived probabilities of their same-job-hour
earning growth to pre-defined non-overlapping bins. The question is
framed as ``suppose that 12 months from now, you are working in the
exact same {[}``main'' if Q11\textgreater{}1{]} job at the same place
you currently work and working the exact same number of hours. In your
view, what would you say is the percentage chance that 12 months from
now: increased by x\% or more?''.

As a special feature of the online questionnaire, the survey only moves
on to the next question if the probabilities filled in all bins add up
to one. This ensures the basic probabilistic consistency of the answers
crucial for any further analysis. Besides, the earning growth
expectation regarding exactly the same position, same hours, and the
same location has two important implications for my analysis. First,
these requirements help make sure the comparability of the answers
across time and also excludes the potential changes in earnings driven
by endogenous labor supply decisions, i.e.~working for longer hours.
Second, the earning expectations and risks measured here are only
conditional on non-separation from the current job. It excludes either
unemployment, i.e.~likely a zero earning, or an upward movement in the
job ladder, i.e.~a different earning growth rate. Therefore, this does
fully reflect the entire income risk profile relevant to each
individual.

Unemployment and other involuntary job separations are undoubtedly
important sources of income risks, but I choose to focus on the
same-job/hour earning with the recognition that individuals' income
expectations, if any, may be easier to be formed for the current
job/hour than when taking into account unemployment risks. Given the
focus of this paper being subjective perceptions, this serves as a
useful benchmark. What is more assuring is that the bias due to omission
of unemployment risk is unambiguous. We could interpret the moments of
same-job-hour earning growth as an upper bound for the level of growth
rate and a lower bound for the income risk. To put it in another way,
the expected earning growth conditional on current employment is higher
than the unconditional one, and the conditional earning risk is lower
than the unconditional one. At the same time, since SCE separately
elicits the perceived probability of losing the current job for each
respondent, I could adjust the measured labor income moments taking into
account the unemployment risk.

\hypertarget{density-estimation-and-variables}{%
\subsection{Density estimation and
variables}\label{density-estimation-and-variables}}

With the histogram answers for each individual in hand, I follow
\cite{engelberg_comparing_2009} to fit each of them with a parametric
distribution accordingly for three following cases. In the first case
when there are three or more intervals filled with positive
probabilities, it will be fitted with a generalized beta distribution.
In particular, if there is no open-ended bin on the left or right, then
two-parameter beta distribution is sufficient. If there is either
open-ended bin with positive probability, since the lower bound or upper
bound of the support needs to be determined, a four-parameter beta
distribution is estimated. In the second case, in which there are
exactly two adjacent intervals with positive probabilities, it is fitted
with an isosceles triangular distribution. In the third case, if there
is only one positive-probability of interval only, i.e.~equal to one, it
is fitted with a uniform distribution.

Since subjective moments such as variance is calculated based on the
estimated distribution, it is important to make sure the estimation
assumptions of the density distribution do not mechanically distort my
cross-sectional patterns of the estimated moments. This is the most
obviously seen in the tail risk measure, skewness. The assumption of log
normality of income process, common in the literature (See again
\cite{blundell_consumption_2008}), implicitly assume zero skewness,
i.e.~that the income increase and decrease from its mean are equally
likely. This may not be the case in our surveyed density for many
individuals. In order to account for this possibility, the assumed
density distribution should be flexible enough to allow for different
shapes of subjective distribution. Beta distribution fits this purpose
well. Of course, in the case of uniform and isosceles triangular
distribution, the skewness is zero by default.

Since the microdata provided in the SCE website already includes the
estimated mean, variance and IQR by the staff economists following the
exact same approach, I directly use their estimates for these moments.
At the same time, for the measure of tail-risk, i.e.~skewness, as not
provided, I use my own estimates. I also confirm that my estimates and
theirs for the first two moments are correlated with a coefficient of
0.9.

For all the moment's estimates, there are inevitably extreme values.
This could be due to the idiosyncratic answers provided by the original
respondent, or some non-convergence of the numeric estimation program.
Therefore, for each moment of the analysis, I exclude top and bottom
\(3\%\) observations, leading to a sample size of around 48,000.

I also recognize what is really relevant to many economic decisions such
as consumption is real income instead of nominal income. I, therefore,
use the inflation expectation and inflation uncertainty (also estimated
from density question) to convert nominal earning growth moments to real
terms for some robustness checks in this paper. In particular, the real
earning growth rate is expected nominal growth minus inflation
expectation.

\begin{eqnarray}
\overline {\Delta y^{r}}_{i,t} = \overline\Delta y_{i,t} - \overline \pi_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray}

The variance associated with real earning growth, if we treat inflation
and nominal earning growth as two independent stochastic variables, is
equal to the summed variance of the two. The independence assumption is
admittedly an imperfect assumption because of the correlation of wage
growth and inflation at the macro level. So it is should be interpreted
with caution.

\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{var^{r}}_{i,t} = \overline{var}_{i,t} + \overline{var}_{i,t}(\pi_{t})
\end{eqnarray}

Not enough information is available for the same kind of transformation
of IQR and skewness from nominal to real, so I only use nominal
variables. Besides, as there are extreme values on inflation
expectations and uncertainty, I also exclude top and bottom \(5\%\) of
the observations. This further shrinks the sample, when using real
moments, to 36,000.

    \hypertarget{perceived-income-risks-basic-facts}{%
\section{Perceived income risks: basic
facts}\label{perceived-income-risks-basic-facts}}

\hypertarget{cross-sectional-heterogeneity}{%
\subsection{Cross-sectional
heterogeneity}\label{cross-sectional-heterogeneity}}

This section inspects some basic cross-sectional patterns of the subject
moments of labor income. In the Figure \ref{fig:histmoms}, I plot the
distribution of perceived income risks in nominal and real terms,
\(\overline{var}_{i,t}\), \(\overline{var^{r}}_{i,t}\).

There is a sizable dispersion in perceived income risks. In both nominal
and real terms, the distribution is right-skewed with a long tail.
Specifically, most of the workers have perceived a variance of nominal
earning growth ranging from zero to \(20\) (a standard-deviation
equivalence of \(4-4.5\%\) income growth a year). But in the tail, some
of the workers perceive risks to be as high as \(7-8\%\) standard
deviation a year. To have a better sense of how large the risk is,
consider a median individual in our sample, who has an expected earnings
growth of \(2.4\%\), and a perceived risk of \(1\%\) standard deviation.
This implies by no means negligible earning risk.
\footnote{In the appendix, I also include histograms of expected income growth and subjective skewness, which show intuitive patterns such as nominal rigidity. Besides, about half of the sample exhibits non-zero skewness in their subjective distribution, indicating asymmetric upper/lower tail risks.}

{[}FIGURE \ref{fig:histmoms} HERE{]}

How are perceived income risks different across a variety of demographic
factors? Empirical estimates of income risks of different demographic
groups from microdata have been
rare\footnote{For instance, \cite{meghir2004income} estimated that high-education group is faced with higher income risks than the low-education group.  \cite{bloom2018great} documented that income risks decreases with age and varies with current income level in a U-shaped.},
not mentioning in subjective risk perceptions. Figure
\ref{fig:ts_incvar_age} plots the average perceived risks of young,
middle-aged, and old workers over the sample period. It is clear that
for most of the months, perceived risks decrease with age.
Hypothetically, this may be either because of more stable earning
dynamics as one is older in the market in reality, or a better grasp of
the true income process and higher subjective certainty. The model I
will build allows both to play a role.

{[}FIGURE \ref{fig:ts_incvar_age} HERE{]}

Another important question is how income risk perceptions depend on the
realized income. This is unclear ex-ante because it depends on the true
income process as well as the perception formation. SCE does not
directly report the current earning by the individual who reports
earning forecasts. Instead, I use what's available in the survey, the
total pretax household income in the past year as a proxy to the past
realizations of labor income. As Figure \ref{fig:barplot_byinc} shows,
perceived risks gradually declines as one's household income increases
for most range of income. But the pattern reverses for the top income
group. Such a non-monotonic relationship between risk perceptions and
past realizations, as I will show later in the theoretical section, will
be reconciled by people's state-dependent attribution and learning.

{[}FIGURE \ref{fig:barplot_byinc} HERE{]}




    \hypertarget{counter-cyclicality-of-perceived-risk}{%
\subsection{Counter-cyclicality of perceived
risk}\label{counter-cyclicality-of-perceived-risk}}

Some studies have documented that income risks are counter-cyclical
based on cross-sectional data.
\footnote{But they differ in exactly which moments of the income are counter-cyclical. For instance, \cite{storesletten2004cyclical} found that variances of income shocks are counter-cyclical, while \cite{guvenen2014nature} and \cite{catherine_countercyclical_2019}, in contrast, found it to be the left skewness.}
It is worth inspecting if the subjective income risk profile has a
similar pattern. Figure \ref{fig:tshe} plots the average perceived
income risks from SCE against the YoY growth rate of average hourly wage
throughout the United States, which shows a clear negative correlation.
Table \ref{macro_corr_he} further confirms such a counter-cyclicality by
reporting the regression coefficients of different measures of average
risks on the wage rate of different lags. All coefficients are
significantly negative.

{[}FIGURE \ref{fig:tshe} HERE{]}

{[}TABLE \ref{macro_corr_he} HERE{]}

The pattern can be also seen at the state level. Table
\ref{macro_corr_he_state} reports the regression coefficients of the
monthly average perceived risk within each state on the state labor
market conditions, measured by either wage growth or the state-level
unemployment rate, respectively. It shows that a tighter labor market
(higher wage growth or a lower unemployment rate) is associated with
lower perceived income risks. Note that our sample stops in June 2019
thus not covering the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020. The
counter-cyclicality will be very likely more salient if it includes the
current period, which was marked by catastrophic labor market
deterioration and increase market risks.

{[}TABLE \ref{macro_corr_he_state} HERE{]}

The counter-cyclicality in subjective risk perceptions seen in the
survey may suggest the standard assumption of state-independent symmetry
in income shocks is questionable. But it may well be, alternatively,
because people's subjective reaction to the positive and negative shocks
are asymmetric even if the underlying process being symmetric. The model
to be constructed in the theoretical section explores the possible role
of both.




    \hypertarget{experiences-and-perceived-risk}{%
\subsection{Experiences and perceived
risk}\label{experiences-and-perceived-risk}}

Different generations also have different perceived income risks. Let us
explore to what extent the cohort-specific risk perceptions are
influenced by the income volatility experienced by that particular
cohort. Different cohorts usually have experienced distinct
macroeconomic histories. On one hand, these non-identical experiences
could lead to long-lasting differences in realized life-long outcomes.
An example is that college graduates graduating during recessions have
lower life-long income than others. (\cite{oreopoulos2012short}). On the
other hand, experiences may have also shaped people's expectations
directly, leading to behavioral heterogeneity across cohorts
(\cite{malmendier2015learning}). Benefiting from having direct access to
the subjective income risk perceptions, I could directly examine the
relationship between experiences and perceptions.

The experienced volatility specific to a certain cohort \(c\) at a given
time \(t\) can be approximated as the average squared residuals from an
income regression based on the corresponding panel sample of labor
income obtained from PSID.
\footnote{I obtain the labor income records of all household heads between 1970-2017. Farm workers, youth and olds and observations with empty entries of major demographic variables are dropped.}
In particular, I first undertake a Miner-style regression using major
demographic variables as regressors. I also include the previous-year
income to account for persistence in the process. Then, for each
cohort-time sample, the regression mean-squared error (RMSE) is used as
the approximate to the cohort-time specific income volatility.

There are two issues associated with such an approximation of individual
experienced volatility. First, I, as an economist with PSID data in my
hand, am obviously equipped with a much larger sample than the sample
size facing an individual that may have entered her experience. Since
larger sample also results in a smaller RMSE, my approximation might be
smaller than the real experienced volatility. Second, however, the
counteracting effect comes from the superior information problem,
i.e.~the information set held by earners in the sample contains what is
not available to econometricians. Therefore, not all known factors
predictable by the individual are used as a regressor. This will bias
upward the estimated experienced volatility. Despite these concerns, my
method serves as a feasible approximation sufficient for my purpose
here.

Figure \ref{fig:var_experience_var_data} plots the logged average
perceived risk from each cohort \(c\) at year \(t\) against logged
experienced volatility estimated from above. It shows a clear positive
correlation between the two, which suggests that cohorts who have
experienced higher income volatility also perceived future income to be
riskier. The results are reconfirmed in Table \ref{micro_reg}, for which
I run a regression of logged perceived risks of each individual in SCE
on the logged experienced volatility specific to her cohort while
controlling individuals age, income, educations, etc. For instance, each
1 percentage increase in experienced volatility is associated with a 3
to 6 percentage point increase in perceived income risks, depending on
the controls included in the regression. What is interesting is that the
coefficient of \(expvol\) declines from 6.31 to 2.92 when controlling
the age effect because that variations in experienced volatility are
indeed partly from age differences. While controlling more individual
factors, the effect of the experienced volatility becomes even stronger.
This implies possible potential heterogeneity as to how experience is
translated into perceived risks.

    \hypertarget{other-individual-characteristics}{%
\subsection{Other individual
characteristics}\label{other-individual-characteristics}}

What other factors are associated with risk perceptions? This section
inspects the question by regressing the perceived income risks at the
individual level on four major blocks of variables: experienced
volatility, demographics, unemployment expectations by the respondent,
as well as job-specific characteristics. The regression is specified as
followed.

\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{risk}_{i,c,t} = \alpha + \beta_0 \textrm{HH}_{i,c,t} + \beta_1 \textrm{expvol}_{c,t} + \beta_2 \textrm{Exp}_{i,c,t} + \beta_4 \textrm{JobType}_{i,c,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray}

The dependent variable is the individual \(i\) from cohort \(c\)'s
perceived risk. Experienced volatility \(\textit{expvol}_{c,t}\) is
cohort-and-time-specific. The second type of factors denoted
\(\textit{HH}_{i,t}\) represents household-specific demographics such as
the age, household income level, education, and gender of the
respondent. Third, \(\textit{Exp}_{i,t}\) represents other subjective
expectations held by the same individual. As far as this paper is
concerned, I include the perceived probability of unemployment herself
and the probability of a higher nationwide unemployment rate. The fourth
block of factors, as called \(\textit{Jobtype}_{i,t}\) includes dummy
variables indicating if the job is part-time or if the work is for
others or self-employed.

Besides, since many of the regressors are time-invariant household
characteristics, I choose not to control household fixed effects in
these regressions (\(\omega_i\)). Throughout all specifications, I
cluster standard errors at the household level because of the concern of
unobservable household heterogeneity.

The regression results reported in Table \ref{micro_reg} are rather
intuitive. From the first to the sixth column, I gradually control more
factors. All specifications confirm that higher experienced volatility
in the past, workers from low-income households, females, and lower
education and self-employed jobs have higher perceived income risks.

In our sample, there are around \(15\%\) (6000) of the individuals who
report themselves to be self-employed instead of working for others. The
effects are statistically and economically significant. Whether a
part-time job is associated with higher perceived risk is ambiguous
depending on if we control household demographics. At first sight,
part-time jobs may be thought of as more unstable. But the exact nature
of part-time job varies across different types and populations. It is
possible, for instance, that the part-time jobs available to high-income
and educated workers bear lower risks than those by the low-income and
low-education groups.

Higher perceived the probability of losing the current job, which I call
individual unemployment risk, \(\textit{UEprobInd}\) is associated with
higher earning risks of the current job. The perceived chance that the
nationwide unemployment rate going up next year, which I call aggregate
unemployment risk, \(\textit{UEprobAgg}\) has a similar correlation with
perceived earning risks. Such a positive correlation is important
because this implies that a more comprehensively measured income risk
facing the individual that incorporates not only the current job's
earning risks but also the risk of unemployment is actually higher.
Moreover, the perceived risk is higher for those whose perceptions of
the earning risk and unemployment risk are more correlated than those
less correlated.

\subsection{Perceived income risk and
decisions}\label{perceived-income-risk-and-decisions}}

Finally, how individual-specific perceived risks affect household
economic decisions such as consumption? The testable prediction is
higher perceived risks shall increase precautionary saving motive
therefore lower future consumption (higher consumption growth.) Although
we cannot directly observe the respondent's spending decisions, we can
alternatively rely on the self-reported spending plan in the SCE to shed
some light on this.

Table \ref{spending_reg} reports the regression results of planned
spending growth over the next year on the expected earning's growth (the
first column) as well as a number of perceived income risk measures.
\footnote{There is one important econometric concern when I run regressions of the decision variable on perceived risks due to the measurement error in the regressor used here. In a typical OLS regression in which the regressor has i.i.d. measurement errors, the coefficient estimate for the imperfectly measured regressor will have a bias toward zero. For this reason, if I find that willingness to consume is indeed negatively correlated with perceived risks, taking into account the bias, it implies that the correlation of the two is greater in the magnitude.}
Each percentage point increase in expected income growth is associated
with a 0.39 percentage point increase in spending growth. At the same
time, one percentage point higher in the perceived risk increases the
planned spending growth by 0.58 percentage. This effect is even stronger
for real income risks. As a double-check, the individual's perceived
probability of a higher unemployment rate next year also has a similar
effect. These results suggest that individuals do exhibit precautionary
saving motives according to their own perceived risks.

\section{Model}\label{model}}

\hypertarget{income-process-and-a-model-of-learning}{%
\subsection{Income process and a model of
learning}\label{income-process-and-a-model-of-learning}}

We start by defining an AR(1) process of the individual income. In
particular, the income of individual \(i\) from the cohort \(c\) at time
\(t\) depends on her previous-period income with a persistence parameter
of \(\rho\) and an individual and time-specific shock
\(\epsilon_{i,c,t}\). I define cohort \(c\) to be measured by the year
of entry in the job market.

\begin{eqnarray}
y_{i,c,t} = \rho y_{i,c,t-1} + \epsilon_{i,c,t}
\end{eqnarray}

It is assumed that the \(\rho\) is the same across all inviduals. Also,
I assume the income shock \(\epsilon_{i,c,t}\) to be i.i.d., namely
independent across individuals and the time,and with an identical
variance, as defined in the equation below. Later sections will relax
this assumption by allowing for cross-sectional correlation, namely some
aggregate risks. Further extensions are also allowed for cohort or
time-specific volatility. The i.i.d. assumption implies at any time
\(t\), variance-covariance matrix of income shocks across individuals
have is a diagonal matrix.

\begin{eqnarray}
E(\epsilon_{t}'\epsilon_{t}|Y_{t-1}) = \sigma^2 I_n \quad \forall t 
\end{eqnarray}

where \(\sigma^2\) is the volatility of income shock and \(I_n\) is an
identity matrix whose length is the number of agents in the economy,
\(n\). Although income volatility is not cohort-specific, any past shock
still created different impacts on the young and old generations because
their length of the proefessional career are different. This is
reminiscent of \cite{bansal2004risks}. Since both \(\rho\) and
\(\sigma^2\) are not cohort-specific, I drop the subscript \(c\) from
now on to avoid clustering.

Both \(\rho\) and \(\sigma\) are ``true'' parameters only known by the
modeler, but unknown by agents in the economy. Individual \(i\) learns
about the income process by ``running'' a regression based on the model
above using a limited sample from her past experience starting from the
year of entering the job market \(c\) up till \(t\). Critically, for
this paper's purpose, I allow the experience used for learning to
include both her own and others' past income over the same period. It is
admittedly bizarre to assume individual agents have access to the whole
population's income. A more realistic assumption could be that only a
small cross-sectional sample is available to the agent. Any scope of
cross-sectional social learning suffices for the point to be made in
this paper.

    \hypertarget{a-baseline-model-of-experience-based-learning}{%
\subsubsection{A baseline model of experience-based
learning}\label{a-baseline-model-of-experience-based-learning}}

If each agent knows \emph{perfectly} the model parameters \(\rho\) and
\(\sigma\), the uncertainty about future income growth is

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
Var^*_{i,t}(\Delta y_{i,t+1}) & =  Var^*_{i,t}(y_{i,t+1}- y_{i,t}) \\ 
& =  Var^*_{i,t}((\rho-1)y_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t+1}) \\
& = Var^*_{i,t}(\epsilon_{i,t+1}) \\
& = \sigma^2
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

The superscript \(*\) is the notation for perfect understanding. The
first equality follows because both \(y_{i,t}\) and the persistent
parameter \(\rho\) is known by the agent. The second follows because
\(\sigma^2\) is also known.

Under \emph{imperfect} understanding and learning, both \(\rho\) and
\(\sigma^2\) are unknown to agents. Therefore, the agent needs to learn
about the parameters from the small panel sample experienced up to that
point of the time. We represent the sample estimates of \(\rho\) and
\(\sigma^2\) using \(\widehat \rho\) and \(\hat{\sigma}^2\).

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\widehat Var_{i,t}(\Delta y_{i,t+1}) & = y_{i,t}^2 \underbrace{\widehat{Var}^{\rho}_{i,t}}_{\text{Persistence uncertainty}} + \underbrace{\hat{\sigma}^2_{i,t}}_{\text{Shock uncertainty}}
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

The perceived risks of future income growth have two components. The
first one comes from the uncertainty about the persistence parameter. It
reflects how uncertain the agent feels about the degree to which
realized income shocks will affect her future income, which is
non-existent under perfect understanding. I will refer to this as the
parameter uncertainty or persistence uncertainty hereafter. Notice the
persistence uncertainty is scaled by the squared size of the
contemporary income. It implies that the income risks are size-dependent
under imperfect understanding. It introduces one of the possible
channels via which current income affects perceived income risk.

The second component of perceived risk has to do with the unrealized
shock itself. Therefore, it can be called shock uncertainty. Because the
agent does not know perfectly the underlying volatility of the income
shock, she makes an estimate based on past volatility. The estimates
\(\hat{\sigma}^2_{i,t}\) can be lower or higher than the true risks, but
it is an unbiased estimator for the true \(\sigma^2\).

We assume agents learn about the parameters using a least-square rule
widely used in the learning literature (For instance,
\cite{evans2012learning}, \cite{malmendier2015learning}) The bounded
rationality prevents her from adopting any more sophisticated rule that
econometricians may consider to be superior to the OLS. (For instance,
OLS applied in autocorrelated models induce bias in estimate.) We first
consider the case when the agent understands that the income shocks are
i.i.d. To put it differently, this is when the agent correctly specify
the income model when learning. The least-square estimate of paramters
are the following.

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat \rho_{i,t} = (\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\sum^{n}_{j=1}y^2_{j,t-k-1})^{-1}(\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\sum^{n}_{j=1}y_{j,t-k-1}y_{j,t-k})
\end{eqnarray}

The variance of sample residuls \(\widehat e\) are used for estimating
the income volatility \(\sigma^2\). It can be seen as the experienced
volatility over the past history.

\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\sigma}^2_{i,t} = s^2_{i,t} = \frac{1}{N_{i,t}-1} \sum^{n}_{j=1}\sum^{t-c}_{k=0} \hat e_{j,t-k}^2
\end{eqnarray}

where \(N_{i,t}\) is the size of the panel sample available to the agent
\(i\) at time t. It is equal to \(n(t-c)\), the number of people in the
sample times the duration of agent \(i\)'s career.

Under i.i.d. assumption, the estimated uncertainty about the estimate is

\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat {Var}^{\rho}_{i,t} = (\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\sum^{n}_{j=1}y^2_{j,t-k-1})^{-1}\widehat{\sigma}^2_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray}

Experience-based learning naturally introduces a mechanism for the
perceived income risks to be cohort-specific and age-specific. Different
generations who have experienced different realizations of the income
shocks have different estimates of \(Var^{\rho}\) and \(\sigma^2\), thus
differ in their uncertainty about future income. In the meantime, people
at an older age are faced with a larger sample size than younger ones,
this will drive the age profile of perceived risks in line with the
observation that the perceived risk is lower as one grows older. Also,
note that the learning literature has explored a wide variety of
assumptions on the gains from learning to decline over time or age.
These features can be easily incorporated into my framework. For now,
equal weighting of the past experience suffices for the exposition here.

We can rewrite the perceived risk under correct model specification as
the following.

\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{Var}_{i,t}(\Delta y_{i,t+1}) = [(\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\sum^{n}_{j=1}y^2_{j,t-k-1})^{-1}y^2_{i,t} + 1] \hat{\sigma}^2_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray}

    \hypertarget{attribution}{%
\subsubsection{Attribution}\label{attribution}}

Attribution means that agents subjectively form perceptions about the
correlation between their own income outcome and others. This opens room
for possible model-misspecification about the nature of income shock due
to bounded rationality. Although people specify the regression model
correctly, they do not necessarily perceive the nature of the income
shocks correctly.

Before introducing the specific mechanism of the attribution error, we
can generally discuss the property of parameter uncertainty for any
general subjective perception of the cross-sectional correlation. Under
the least-square learning rule, the perceived uncertainty about the
parameter estimate now takes a more general form as below. It is
equivalent to accounting for within-time clustering in computing
standard errors.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\tilde {Var}^{\rho}_{i,t} & =   (\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\sum^{n}_{j=1}y^2_{j,t-k-1})^{-1}(\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\tilde \Omega_{i,t-k})(\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\sum^{n}_{j=1}y^2_{j,t-k-1})^{-1}
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

where \(\tilde \Omega_{t-k}\) is the perceived variance-covariance of
income and income shocks within each point of time. It reflect how
individual \(i\) thinks about the correlation between her own income and
others'.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\tilde \Omega_{i,t} = \tilde E_{i,t}(Y_{t-1}e_{t}'e_{t}Y_{t-1})
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

If we assume constant group size \(n\) over time and the
homoscedasticity, i.e.~income risks \(\sigma\) do not change over time,
given the individual ascribes a subjective correlation coefficient of
\(\tilde \delta_{\epsilon, i,t}\) across income shocks and a correlation
\(\tilde \delta_{y, i,t}\) across the levels of income,
\(\tilde \Omega_{i,t}\) can be approximated as the following. (See the
appendix for derivation) (This is analogous to the cluster-robust
standard error by \cite{cameron2011robust}. But the distinction is that
both long-run and short-run correlation are subjective now. )

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\tilde \Omega_{t} & \approx \sum^{n}_{j=1}y^2_{j,t} (1+\tilde \delta_{y,i,t}\tilde \delta_{\epsilon,i,t}(n-1))\tilde \sigma^2_{t}
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

Therefore, the parameter uncertainty under the subjective attribution
takes a following form comparable with that derive for i.i.d. in
previous section.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\tilde {Var}^{\rho}_{i,t} & = (\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\sum^{n}_{j=1}y^2_{j,t-k-1})^{-1}(1+ \tilde\delta_{i,t}(n-1))\tilde{\sigma}^2_{t}
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

Where we bundle the two correlation coefficients parameters together as
a single parameter of the attribution correlation, which represents the
degree of attribution errors.

\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde \delta_{y,i,t}\tilde \delta_{\epsilon,i,t}\equiv \tilde \delta_{i,t}  
\end{eqnarray}

The subjective attribution is jointly by two perceived correlation
parameters, \(\tilde \delta_{\epsilon}\) and \(\tilde \delta_y\). They
can be more intuively thought as long-run attribution and short-run
attribution, respectively, because the former is the perceived
correlation in the level of the income and later in income shocks. The
multiplication of two jointly governs the degree to which the agents
inflate experienced volatility in forming perceptions about future
income risks. \(\tilde \delta_{i,t} = 0\) if the agent \(i\) thinks that
her income shock or the long-run income is uncorrelated with others'
(\(\tilde \delta_{\epsilon} = 0\) or \(\tilde \delta_y = 0\)). In
contrats, \(\tilde \delta_{i,t} = 1\), attaining its maximum value if
the agent thinks both her income shock and income is perfectly
correlated with others. In general, \(\tilde \delta_{\epsilon,i,t}\) and
\(\tilde \delta_{y,i,t}\) are not necessarily consistent with the true
income process. Since long-run correlation increases with the the
short-run correlation, bundling them together as a single parameter is
feasible.

Another important aspect regarding attribution is that it changes
perceived risk only through its effect on parameter uncertainty but not
on shock uncertainty. Attributing the individual outcome either to
idiosyncrasy or common factors do not change how agents think of the
variance of the shock, but changes the uncertainty about how persistent
the effect of the shock will be. Therefore, for the attribution to play
a meaningful role in perceived risk, the size of the income shock shall
not be excessively so big that it overshadows the role of persistence
uncertainty.


    \hypertarget{attribution-errors}{%
\subsubsection{Attribution errors}\label{attribution-errors}}

The framework set up above can neatly incorporate the psychological
tendency of ascribing bad luck to external causes and good luck to
internal ones. The manifesto of the attribution error in this context is
that people asymmetrically assign the subjective correlation
\(\tilde \delta_{i,t}\) depending on the sign of the recent income
change (or the realized shocks). An internal attribution implies a
positive change in income induces the agent to maintain the independence
assumption, while an external attribution means a negative change in
income makes the agent interpret the income shock as a common shock and
thus positively correlated with others at each point of the time. More
formally, we define the attribution error as the assymetric assignment
of the value of \(\tilde\delta_{i,t}\), specified as below.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\textrm{Internal attribution: }\quad \tilde\delta_{i,t} = 0 \quad \textrm{if} \quad \Delta y_{i,t}>0 \\
\textrm{External attribution: }\quad \tilde\delta_{i,t} = 1 \quad \textrm{if} \quad \Delta y_{i,t}<0
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

Here, I let the attribution be contingent on the income change
\(\Delta y_{i,t}\). An alternative way of modeling it is contingency on
forecast errors, \(\widehat e_{i,t}\), namely the unexpected income
shock to agent \(i\) at time \(t\). The distinction between the two
modeling techniques is indistinguishable in terms of qualitative
predictions I will discuss next.

One can immediately show the following the persistence uncertainty with
external attribution is no smaller than that with internal attribution.

\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde {Var}^{\rho}_{i,t} \geq \widehat {Var}^{\rho}_{i,t} \quad \forall \quad \tilde\delta_{i,t} \geq 0
\end{eqnarray}

where the equality holds as a special case when
\(\tilde\delta_{i,t} = 0\). The left hand side monotonically increases
with \(\tilde \delta_{i,t}\).

In the meantime, the shock uncertainty estimate,\(\sigma^2\) remain the
same no matter if the attribution error arises, both of which are equal
to the sample average of regression residuals \(s^2\).

\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\sigma}^2_{i,t} = \widehat{\sigma}^2_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray}

Combining the two relations above, one can show the perceived risks of
an unlucky person is unambiguously higher than that of a lucky one.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\tilde {Var}_{i,t}(\Delta y_{i,t+1}) & = y_{i,t-1}^2 \tilde{Var}^{\rho}_{i,t} + \tilde{\sigma}^2_{i,t} \\
& = [(\sum^{t-c}_{k=0}\sum^{n}_{j=1}y^2_{j,t-k-1})^{-1}(1+ \tilde\delta_{i,t}(n-1))y^2_{i,t} + 1] \tilde{\sigma}^2\\
& \geq \widehat {Var}_{i,t}(\Delta y_{i,t+1}) 
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

where, again, the equality holds without attribution errors, i.e.
\(\tilde \delta_{i,t} = 0\). One way to rephrase the inequality above is
that the unlucky group excessively extrapolates the realized shocks into
her perception of risks. There is no distinction between the two groups
if there is no attribution errors.

We have the following predictions about the perceived income risks from
the analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Higher experienced volatility, measured by
  \(s^2 \equiv \tilde{\sigma}^2_{i,t}\) leads to higher perceived income
  risks.
\item
  In the same time, future perceptions of the risks inflate the past
  volatility by proportionately depending on their subjective
  attribution. A higher degree of external attribution reflected by a
  higher \(\tilde \delta_{i,t}\) implies a higher inflaiton of past
  volatility into future. (See Figure \ref{fig:corr_var}.)
\item
  With attribution errors, people project past experienced volatility
  into perceived risks disproportionately depending on the subjective
  attribution. A higher perceived attribution to common shocks, a bigger
  \(\tilde \delta_{i,t}\) induces a higher perceived risk. See the
  comparison between Figure \ref{fig:var_experience_var}. This is
  different from the scenario without attribution errors.
\end{itemize}

It is important to note that this difference still arises even if one
assumes the underlying shocks are indeed non-independent. Although
different types of income shocks have different implications as to which
group correctly or mis-specifies the model, it does not alter the
distinction between the lucky and unlucky group. To put it bluntly, the
underlying process determines who is over-confident or under-confident.
But the lucky group is always more confident than the unlucky group.


    \hypertarget{extrapolative-attribution}{%
\subsubsection{Extrapolative
attribution}\label{extrapolative-attribution}}

The baseline model only lets the sign of the recent income change induce
attribution errors, and assumes away the possibility of the attribution
errors to depend on the magnitude of the recent changes endogenously.
This is reflected in the model assumption that \(\tilde \delta_i\) could
take either 1 or 0 depending on the sign of the recent income change. We
could alternatively allow the attributed correlation \(\tilde \delta_i\)
to be a function of the \(\Delta(y_{i,t})\). This will open the room for
income changes of different salience to induce different degrees of
attribution errors.

In order to capture this size-dependent pattern, I choose an attribution
function that takes the following form as the following. It does not
have to be this function in particular, but its properties suit the
purpose here.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\tilde \delta(\Delta y_{i,t}) = 1- \frac{1}{(1+e^{\alpha-\theta \Delta y_{i,t}})}
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

Basically, the attribution function is a variant of a logistic function
with its function value bounded between \([0,1]\). It takes an s-shape
and the parameter \(\theta\) governs the steepness of the s-shape around
its input value. \(\alpha\) is adjustable parameter chosen such that the
attribution free of errors happen to be equal to the true correlation
between individuals \(\delta\), which here takes values of zero for
independence assumption. In the model, \(\theta\) is the parameter that
governs the degree of the attribution errors. It takes any non-negative
value. Although the qualitative pattern induced by the attribution
errors stands for any positive \(\theta\), letting it be a parameter
leaves modelers the room to recover it from subjective risks data. The
attribution function under different \(\theta\) is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:theta_corr}. The higher \(\theta\) is, the more sensitive the
assigned correlation is to the size of the shock, thus inducing a higher
dispersion of the perceived correlation between the lucky group and the
unlucky group.

\subsection{Simulation}\label{simulation}}

\hypertarget{current-income-and-perceived-risks}{%
\subsubsection{Current income and perceived
risks}\label{current-income-and-perceived-risks}}

How do perceived risks depend on the current income level of
\(y_{i,t}\)? Since the recent income changes \(\Delta y_{i,t}\) triggers
asymmetric attribution, the perceived risks depend on the current level
of income beyond the past-dependence of future income on current income
that is embodied in the AR(1) process. In particular,
\(\widehat{Var}^\rho_{i,t}\) does not depend on \(\Delta y_{i,t}\) while
\(\tilde{Var}^\rho_{i,t}\) does and is always greater than the former as
a positive, it will amplify the loading of the current level of income
into perceived risks about future income. This generates a U-shaped
perceived income profile depending on current level income.

Figure \ref{fig:var_recent} and \ref{fig:var_recent_sim} plots both the
theory-predicted and simulated correlation between \(y_{i,t}\) and
perceived income risks with/without attribution errors. In the former
scenario, perceived risks only mildly change with current income and the
entire income profile of perceived risk is approximately flat. In the
latter scenario, in contrast, perceived risks exhibit a clear U-shape
across the income distribution. People sitting at both ends of the
income distribution have high perceived risks than ones in the middle.
The non-monotonic of the income profile arise due to the combined
effects directly from \(y_{i,t}\) and indirectly via its impact on
\(\tilde Var^{\rho}\). The former effect is symmetric around the
long-run average of income (zero here). Deviations from the long-run
mean on both sides lead to higher perceived risk. The latter
monotonically decreases with current income because higher income level
is associated with a more positive income change recently. The two
effects combined create a U-shaped pattern.

A subtle but interesting point is that the U-shape is skewed toward
left, meaning perceived risks decrease with the income over the most
part of the income distribution before the pattern reverses. More
intuitively, it means that although low and high income perceived risks
to be higher because of its deviation from the its long-run mean. This
force is muted for the high income group because they have a lower
peceived risks due to the attribution errors.

    \hypertarget{aggregate-risk}{%
\subsubsection{Aggregate risk}\label{aggregate-risk}}

Previously, I assume the underlying shock is i.i.d. This section
considers the implication of the attribution errors in the presence of
both aggregate and idiosyncratic risks. This can be modeled by assuming
that the shocks to individuals' income are positively correlated with
each other at each point of the time. Denoting \(\delta>0\) as the true
cross-sectional correlation of income shocks, the conditional
variance-covariance of income shocks within each period is the
following.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
E(\epsilon_{t}'\epsilon_{t}|Y_{t-1}) = \Sigma^2 = \sigma^2\Omega \quad \forall t  
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

where \(\Omega\) takes one in its diagonal and \(\delta\) in
off-diagonal.

The learning process and the attribution errors all stay the same as
before. Individuals specify their subjective structure of the shocks
depending on the sign and size of their own experienced income changes.
By the same mechanism elaborated above, a lucky person has lower
perceived risks than her unlucky peer at any point of the time. This
distinction between the two group stays the same even if the underlying
income shocks are indeed correlated.

What's new in the presence of aggregate risks lies in the behaviors of
average perceived risks, because there is an aggregate shock that drives
the comovement of the income shocks affecting individuals. Compared to
the environment with pure idiosyncratic risks, there is no longer an
approximately equal fraction of lucky and unlucky agents at a given
time. Instead, the relative fraction of each group depends on the
recently realized aggregate shock. If the aggregate shock is positive,
more people have experienced good luck and may, therefore, underestimate
the correlation (a smaller \(\tilde \delta\)). This drives down the
average perceived income risks among the population. If the aggregate
shock is negative, more people have just experienced income decrease
thus arriving at a higher perceived income uncertainty.

This naturally leads to a counter-cyclical pattern of the average
perceived risks in the economy. The interplay of aggregate risks and
attribution errors adds cyclical movements of the average perceived
risks. The two conditions are both necessary to generate this pattern.
Without the aggregate risk, both income shocks and perceived income
shocks are purely idiosyncratic and they are averaged out in the
aggregate level. Without attribution errors, agents symmetrically
process experiences when forming future risk perceptions.

Figure \ref{fig:recent_change_var_sim1} illustrates the first point. The
scatter plots showcase the correlation between average income changes
across population and average perceive risks under purely idiosyncratic
risks and aggregate risks. The negative correlation with aggregate risks
illustrate the counter-cylical perceived risks. There is no such a
correlation under purely idiosyncratic risks. Figure
\ref{fig:recent_change_var_sim2} testifies the second point. It plots
the same correlation with and without attribution errors when the
aggregate risk exists. Attribution errors brings about the asymmetry not
seen when the bias is absent.



    \hypertarget{coclusion}{%
\section{Coclusion}\label{coclusion}}

How do people form perceptions about their income risks? Theoretically,
this paper builds an experience-based learning model that features an
imperfect understanding of the size of the risks as well as its nature.
By extending the learning-from-experience into a cross-sectional
setting, I introduce a mechanism in which future risk perceptions are
dependent upon past income volatility or cross-sectional distributions
of the income shocks. I also introduce a novel channel - subjective
attribution, into the learning to capture how income risk perceptions
are also affected by the subjective determination of the nature of
income risks. It is shown that the model generates a few testable
predictions about the relationship between experience/age/income and
perceived income risks.

Empirically, I utilize recently available panel of income density
surveys of U.S. earners to shed light directly on a subjective income
risk profiles. I explore the cross-sectional heterogeneity in income
risk perceptions across ages, generations, and income group as well as
its cyclicality with the current labor market outcome. I found that risk
perceptions are positively correlated with experienced income
volatility, therefore differing across age and cohorts. I also found
perceived income risks of earners counter-cyclically react to the recent
labor market conditions.

As a next step, the project will build the experience-based-learning
based on subjective attribution model into an otherwise life cycle model
of consumption/saving.
