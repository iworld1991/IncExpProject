    "### Summary of my research question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Econometricians have realied only on realized income/earning series to estimate the variance of income shocks of different degrees of persistence. But now, since the density forecasts of individual earning growth(perceived income risks) has been directly elicited, we can do the following:\n",
    "  - Using the additional moments to identify the income risks\n",
    "  - Compare it with the risks that are only identified from the realized series, one way to characterize the deviations of perceived income process from the full-information rational expectation benchmark\n",
    "     - For instance, if agents overestimate their permanent income risks?\n",
    "     - If agents overestimate the persistence of the income process \n",
    "     - To what extent, the cross-sectional inequality resulting from the income risks assumed by econometricians are perceived by the agents themselves.\n",
    "        - If agents know more than econometricians about their individual earnings, the perceived risks may be lower than econometrician's estimates?\n",
    "        - Or actually, agents, due to inattention or other reasons, tend to think the overall risk is higher?\n",
    "     - Finally, not just the process of earning itself, but also its covariance with macro-environment, risky asset returns, etc. \n",
    "        - For instance, if perceived income risks are counter-cyclical, it has important labor supply and portfolio implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The advantage of doing this\n",
    "  - Econometricians have no full access to what agents truely know in their information set. With expectations and perceived income risks help solve this problem. \n",
    "     - Insurance or information problem in consumption literature: what is interpreted as excessive sensitivity may be simply because agents do not have access to the recently realized shocks.\n",
    "  - To the extent that agents make decisions based on their perceptions instead of what is considered as the true objective law of the motion, understanding the perceived income risks profile and its correlation structure with other macro variables are the keys to explain their behavior patterns. \n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "- A bigger-picture question\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The approach that I am proposing here is a natural development from the existing literature of expectation formation. One of the common practices in this literature is to compare the measured expectations from surveys with the law of the systems independently identified by econometricians and interpret all deviations of the former to the latter as the evidence for irrationality. It is true that this has proved to be fruitful and refreshing compared to the earlier macroeconomic tradition that solely relies on the stringent assumption of rationality. But such practices implicitly assume the process discovered by econometricians is the \"true\" one. It does not recognize at all the use of large-sized surveys of expectations in discovering the law of the system besides making a case about how expectations are not rational. Therefore, a rather obvious reconciliation building upon the existing literature is to utilize jointly the realized data and expectations to understand the \"true\" process, while allowing for the partial rationality of the modelers and agents in the model. \n",
    "   - The advantage of doing this is \n",
    "      - One does not need to make a stringent assumption about either agents' full rationality or econometricians' correctness of model specification.\n",
    "      - Utilize the information from expectations to understand the true law of the system.\n",
    "   - Once we take this step, it is natural to incorporate specific mechanisms of expectation formation into a full-fledged structural model that contains optimizing decisions and general equilibrium forces.   "
