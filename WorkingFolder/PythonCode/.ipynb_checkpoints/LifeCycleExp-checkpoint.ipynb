    "## A life-cycle model of consumption/saving with experience-based income expectations and risk perceptions \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "- This life-cycle model is an extension of Gourinchas and Parker (2002) in two following dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Instead of taking the size of permanent and transitory income risks as given as assumed by the economists, agents endogenously learn about the income risks and form income expectations based on their past experiences. Therefore, income expectations/variances are age-cohort specific \n",
    "    - Depending on if there is subjective attribution, the income expectations and risk perceptions will be state-dependent. \n",
    "    - From the point view of solving the dynamic problem, this means that the mean/variance of the perceived income at any given time $t$ become other two state variables, in addition to asset and saving. \n",
    "      - They are exogeous state in the sense that agents' decision will not affect the law of the motion. Also, there will not be feed-back loop from the market outcome.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Instead of partial equilibrium, I explore the general equilibrium and its distributional features in the presence of heterogeneous agents in terms of age, experiences, and beliefs. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- In terms of the implementation, since the heterogenous perceptions are exogenous states that depend on the cross-sectional distributions of income realizations in the past, we can separate the perception formation problem from the standard life-cycle decision problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - We need to solve the life-cycle problem for a list of possible grids of \"perceived\" parameters. For each of this problem, the policies functions are still only dependent on the age and assets. \n",
    "  - Then we simulate the income realizations for a cross-sectional sample of N agents over a life cycle.\n",
    "     - There can be either idiosyncratic or aggregate risks.  \n",
    "  - The simulated histories will produce \n",
    "      - life-cycle perception profiles of each individual based on the past income realizations. \n",
    "      - then, the life-cycle profiles of consumption and assets of each individuals and its aggregate distributions using the perception-specific policy function solved from the begining.   \n",
    "      \n",
    "      - this gives us the aggregate consumption/savings, that may be potentially used to solve general equilibrium models. "

    "Each consumer solves a life-cycle consumption/saving problem formulated by <cite data-cite=\"gourinchas2002consumption\">Gourinchas and Parker, 2002</cite>. There is only one deviation from the original model: each agent imperfectly knows the parameters of income process over the life cycle and forms his/her best guess at each point of the time based on past experience. I first set up the model under the assumption of perfect understanding and then extend it to the imperfect understanding scenarior in the next section.   \n",

    "### The standard life-cycle problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent works for $T$ periods since entering the labor market, during which he/she earns stochastic labor income $y_\\tau$ at the work-age of $\\tau$. After retiring at age of $T+1$, the agent lives for for another $L-T$ periods of life. Since a cannonical life-cycle problem is the same in nature regardless of the cohort and calender time, we set up the problem generally along the age of work $\\tau$. The consumer chooses the whole future consumption path to maximizes expected life-long utility. \n",

We assume away the bequest motive and preference-shifter along life cycle that are present in the original model without loss of the key insights regarding income risks. \n",

    "where $m_\\tau$ is the total cash in hand at the begining of period $\\tau$. $R$ is the risk-free interest rate. Note that after retirement labor income is zero through the end of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stochastic labor income during the agent's career consists of a mulplicative predictable component by known factors $Z_\\tau$ and a stochastic component $\\epsilon_{\\tau}$ which embodies shocks of different nature.  \n",

    "Notice here I explicitly include the predictable component, deviating from the common practice in the literature. Although under perfect understanding, the predictable component does not enter consumption decision effectively since it is anticipated ex ante, this is no longer so once we introduce imperfect understanding regarding the parameters of the income process $\\phi$. The prediction uncertainty enters the perception of income risks. We will return to this point in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The stochastic shock to income $\\epsilon$ is composed of two components: a permanent one $p_t$  and a transitory one $u$. The former grows by a age-specific growth rate $G$ along the life cycle and is subject to a shock $n$ at each period. \n",

    "The permanent shock $n$ follows a log normal distribution, $ln(n_\\tau) \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2_\\tau)$. The transitory shock $u$ either takes value of zero with probability of $0\\leq p<1$, i.e. unemployment, or otherwise follows a log normal with $ln(u_\\tau) \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2_u)$. Following <cite data-cite=\"gourinchas2002consumption\">Gourinchas and Parker, 2002</cite>, I assume the size of the volatility of the two shocks are time-invariant. The results of this paper are not sensitive to this assumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we do not seek to differentiate the aggregate/idiosyncratic components of either one the two enter the individual consumption problem indifferently under perfect understanding. With imperfect understanding and subjective attribution, however, the differences of the two matters since it affects the prediction uncertainty and perceived income risks. \n",

On the backgroud, the income process parameters $\\Gamma = [\\phi,\\sigma_n,\\sigma_u]$ affect the consumption decisions. But to the extent that the agents have perfect knowledge of them, they are simply taken as given. \n",

    "### Under imperfect understanding/learning from experience\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial deviation of this model from the standard framework reproduced above is that the agents do not know about the income parameters $\\Gamma$, and the decisions are only based on their best guess obtained through learning from experience in a manner we formulate in the previous section. This changes the problem in at least two ways. First, given agents potentially differ in their experiences, perceived income processes differ. Second, even if under same experiences, different subjective determinations of the nature of income shocks result in different risk perceptions. To allow for the cross-sectional heterogeneity across individuals and cohorts in income risk perceptions, now explicitly define the problem using agent-time-cohort-specific value function. For agent $i$ from cohort $c=t-\\tau$ at time $t$, the value function is the following.\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the key difference of the new value function from the one under a perfect understanding is that expectational operator of next-period value function becomes subjective and potentially agent-time-specific. Another way to put it is that $E_{i,\\tau,t}$ is conditional on the most recent parameter estimate of the income process $\\tilde \\Gamma_{i,\\tau,t} = \\left[\\tilde \\phi_{i,\\tau,t},\\tilde \\sigma_{n,i,\\tau,t}, \\tilde \\sigma_{u,i,\\tau,t}\\right]$ and the uncertainty about the estimate $Var_{i,\\tau,t}(\\tilde \\phi)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The perceived income risk affects the value of the expected value. It implicitly contains two components. The first is the shock uncertainty that can be predicted at best by the past income volatility estimation of different components. The second is the parameter uncertainty regarding the agents' estimation of a parameter associated with the deterministic components $\\phi$. Since both components imply a further dispersion from the perfect understanding case, it will unambiguously induce a stronger precautionary saving motive than the latter case. \n",
