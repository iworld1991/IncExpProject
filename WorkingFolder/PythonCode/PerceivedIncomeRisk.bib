	abstract = {The paper investigates the implications of the omitted information problem – that is, the econometric problem which arises because an econometrician cannot explicitly include the complete set of variables potentially used by agents – in the context of the "excess smoothness" phenomenon posed by Deaton 11987]. The paper shows that an econometrician who fails to take into account the effects of omitted information will incorrectly conclude that an empirical finding of excess smoothness of consumption implies that the income process is nonstationary. By contrast, with a more thorough understanding of the omitted information problem, the finding of excess smoothness of consumption is easily explained with two assumptions: a) the consumption data is generated by the excess sensitivity alternative hypothesis, in which consumption is a weighted average of current income and permanent income, and b) agents are forecasting on the basis of a larger information set than the econometrician. Further, excess smoothness is revealed to be consistent with a wide range of stationary income processes as well as nonstationary income processes. Thus the common presumption that the excess smoothness phenomenon is linked in an essential way to the stationarity or nonstationarity of the income process evaporates when omitted information is taken into consideration.},

	abstract = {Economists commonly suppose that persons have probabilistic expectations for uncertain events, yet empirical research measuring expectations was long rare. The inhibition against collection of expectations data has gradually lessened, generating a substantial body of recent evidence on the expectations of broad populations. This paper first summarizes the history leading to development of the modern literature and overviews its main concerns. I then describe research on three subjects that should be of direct concern to macroeconomists: expectations of equity returns, inflation expectations, and professional macroeconomic forecasters. I also describe work that questions the assumption that persons have well-defined probabilistic expectations and communicate them accurately in surveys. Finally, I consider the evolution of thinking about expectations formation in macroeconomic policy analysis. I favorably observe the increasing willingness of theorists to study alternatives to rational expectations assumptions, but I express concern that models of expectations formation will proliferate in the absence of empirical research to discipline thinking. To make progress, I urge measurement and analysis of the revisions to expectations that agents make following occurrence of unanticipated shocks.},

We find that, following improvements in financial situation, individuals tend to form extrapolative expectations and are excessively optimistic about the future. However, following a deterioration in financial situation, there is an increase in the dispersion of forecasts: individuals increase both their subjective probability of a future deterioration (consistent with extrapolative behavior) and the probability of a future improvement (mean-reversion). On average the second effect dominates after an earnings decline, with individuals expecting too much mean-reversion. This optimism is reflected in lower savings and higher borrowing, with significant negative implications for future household finances.},

With an estimated relative risk aversion of 5 and yearly participation cost of \$290, the model matches the evolution of wealth, of participation and of the conditional equity share over the life-cycle. Nonetheless, I find that cyclical skewness increases the equity premium by at most 0.5\%.},

create panel data on consumption for the Panel Study of Income Dynamics using
an imputation procedure based on food demand estimates from the Consumer
Expenditure Survey. We document a disjuncture between income and consumption
inequality over the 1980s and show that it can be explained by changes in
the persistence of income shocks. We find some partial insurance of permanent
shocks, especially for the college educated and those near retirement. We
find full insurance of transitory shocks except among poor households. Taxes,
transfers, and family labor supply play an important role in insuring permanent
shocks. (JEL D12, D31, D91, E21)},

@article{guvenen_empirical_2009,
	title = {An empirical investigation of labor income processes},
	abstract = {In this paper, I reassess the evidence on labor income risk. There are two leading views on the nature of the income process in the current literature. The ﬁrst view, which I call the “Restricted Income Proﬁles” (RIP) process, holds that individuals are subject to large and very persistent shocks, while facing similar life-cycle income proﬁles. The alternative view, which I call the “Heterogeneous Income Proﬁles” (HIP) process, holds that individuals are subject to income shocks with modest persistence, while facing individualspeciﬁc income proﬁles. I ﬁrst show that ignoring proﬁle heterogeneity, when in fact it is present, introduces an upward bias into the estimates of persistence. Second, I estimate a parsimonious parameterization of the HIP process that is suitable for calibrating economic models. The estimated persistence is about 0.8 in the HIP process compared to about 0.99 in the RIP process. Moreover, the heterogeneity in income proﬁles is estimated to be substantial, explaining between 56 to 75 percent of income inequality at age 55. I also ﬁnd that proﬁle heterogeneity is substantially larger among higher educated individuals. Third, I discuss the source of identiﬁcation—in other words, the aspects of labor income data that allow one to distinguish between the HIP and RIP processes. Finally, I show that the main evidence against proﬁle heterogeneity in the existing literature—that the autocorrelations of income changes are small and negative—is also replicated by the HIP process, suggesting that this evidence may have been misinterpreted.},

Economically plausible calibrations suggest young investors should take substantial short positions in the stock market. Because of cointegration the young agent's human capital effectively becomes "stock-like." However, for older agents with shorter timesto-retirement, cointegration does not have sufficient time to act, and thus their human capital becomes more "bond-like." Together, these effects create hump-shaped life-cycle portfolio holdings, consistent with empirical observation. These results hold even when asset return predictability is accounted for.},

This important contribution has been overlooked in a recent literature analyzing income and consumption in panel data. I examine Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2008) as an important example for which time aggregation has quantitatively large effects. Using new techniques to correct for the problem, I find the estimate for the partial insurance to transitory shocks, originally estimated to be 0.05, increases to 0.24. This larger estimate resolves the dissonance between the low partial consumption insurance estimates of Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2008) and the high marginal propensities to consume found in the natural experiment literature.},
